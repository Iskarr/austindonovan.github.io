            <br />
            A land of ancient settlements, pioneers, missiles and race cars, the
            Utah town of Tooele rests along the shores of the Great Salt Lake
            just 34 miles from Salt Lake City and boasts history and landmarks
            aplenty. But for Utah locals, how you pronounce this town’s name is
            a dead giveaway of one thing: You’re not from around these parts.
            <br />
            <br />
            So let’s get the vernacular straight first. Tooele is not pronounced
            Too-LEE or Too-ELL as the spelling suggests but Too-WILL-a. Adding
            to the confusion, the county was first spelled Tuilla but changed to
            Tooele in 1852 when Deseret’s boundaries (a precursor territory to
            today’s Utah) were extended to California. Today, folks are still
            arguing about where the name originated. Some think it’s taken from
            the native Goshute Indian word for "bear," while others say it’s a
            corrupted spelling of “tule,” a common weed that grows in swampy
            areas of this valley. <br />
            <br />Regardless of who’s correct, this agrarian community has grown
            up since its founding, expanding from 1,200 residents at the turn of
            the century to more than 33,000 people today. The curious case of
            Tooele’s name is only a small piece of this town’s fascinating past.
          </p>
          <h2>Goshutes</h2>
          <p>
            About 100 Goshute Indians lived in the Tooele Valley when Capt.
            Howard Stansbury surveyed the region for the U.S. Army in 1853. The
            Goshutes – who were said to “have no friends and few enemies” –
            lived primarily off of berries, seeds, jack rabbits, deer and
            insects. Their homes were of cedar, brushes, caves or dugouts, and
            their clothing was made of rabbit or deer hides.
          </p>
          <h3>Pioneers and Mining</h3>
          <p>
            On Sept. 4, 1849, three Mormon pioneer families settled on a small
            stream south of present Tooele City. A few months later four men
            obtained timber rights from Small Canyon (today’s Middle Canyon) and
            Big Canyon (Settlement Canyon). Tooele City was incorporated on
            January 20, 1853 and named county seat on January 18, 1861. Tooele
            was primarily an agricultural community and grew to a population of
            about 1,200 at the turn of the century. Many of the prominent
            families who settled Tooele have descendants living in the area.
            Like their ancestors, these families play an integral role in
            building our community.
            <br />
            Tooele transformed into an industrialized city during the first half
            of the 20th century and the population increased to 5,000 people by
            1930. The transformation was boosted by the construction of
            railroads and the opening of the International Smelting and Refining
            Company, east of Tooele. The Tooele Valley Railroad, a seven mile
            line, ran from the smelter west to the Union Pacific Railroad main
            line. In the eastern section of Tooele, “New Town” was built for
            many of the 1,000 smelter workers. Families from the Balkans, Italy,
            Greece, and Asia Minor lived in this area and formed their own
            community. New Town included its own school, church, culture and
            numerous languages.
          </p>
          <h3>Defense</h3>
          <p>
            Outbreak of World War II brought the establishment of military bases
            in the area that strengthened the nation’s defense, boosted the
            local economy, and created a dramatic change in Tooele’s history.
            Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, a 25,000-acre tract southwest
            of Tooele was selected as a site where the Tooele Ordnance Depot was
            built in 1942. A storage depot for chemical weapons was also
            constructed 20 miles south of Tooele City. These weapons are now
            being destroyed by incineration at the Deseret Chemical Depot.
            Tooele’s heritage was further enriched in the 1950s and 1960s as
            many Hispanic families moved to the area to support the expanding
            mission of the depot. Men and women of Tooele played vital roles in
            supporting the soldiers in the field during World War II, the Korean
            Conflict, Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. The name of the
            depot has changed from Tooele Ordnance Depot to Tooele Army Depot
            and most recently TEAD. In 1993, at the end of the Cold War, the
            depot was designated for “base re-alignment” by the Department of
            Defense. The TEAD workforce, that once reached as many as 5,000
            employees has been reduced to about 400 workers today. About 1,700
            acres of depot property was annexed into the city. The Army conveyed
            40 acres and its multi-million dollar Consolidated Maintenance
            Facility to Tooele City in 1996. This building was then sold to
            Penske Realty of Utah and Detroit Diesel opened a re-manufacturing
            plant that currently employs about 400 people. In December of 1998,
            over 1,600 acres of industrial property and buildings were conveyed
            to Tooele City. The parcel was sold to a developer the Utah
            Industrial Depot was formed. In 1999, the Utah Industrial Depot,
            attracted 168 new jobs. The Utah Industrial Depot was sold to the
            Ninigret Group in 2013 and renamed Ninigret Depot. The Ninigret
            Depot is a premier business park in northern Utah for idustry and
            commerce and is in the process of attracting new private businesses
            to the area.
