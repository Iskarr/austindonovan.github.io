          You might be wondering how Unity applies Hick's law, along with white
          space, when you first go to the site you will be greeted with a mostly
          white spaced site that then also displays its most prominant products,
          Unity Pro, Unity Reflects, Unity Build Server and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          These options are close within proximity of each other, but most
          importantly, they display their best products up front and don't give
          you to many options to choose from. The white space use is also
          interesting because for learning such as automotive or film, they
          offer you learn more but don't take away from the product options
          below them.

          Pluralsight is quite unique in the way that it has some content that
          is related, but at the same time has the call to action buttons more
          prominant up front. This means that you will notice right away that
          the first thing they want you to see is the banner, build better
          (skills, processes, teams, products, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then call to action which to view plans or try for free, they want you
          to see the plans but don't make it impossible to use both. thye use
          vivid colors from the background they use as a banner as well and then
          below without scrolling, you can see trending technologies that you
          might want to look into.

        <h2>Fitt's law and contrast</h2>
        <a
          target="_blank"

        <p>
          In this example, I chose Spotify, not because it was in the example of
          universal web design princles, but because it has changed since it was
          talked about in 2019, and how it more closely resembles the PARC rules
          as well as Fitt's law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another huge aspect to the Spotify site is the way it handles contrast
          compared to the other sites. They decided to use vibrant colors that
          contrast say an album cover. Allowing for you to better visually see
          the site you're on.
